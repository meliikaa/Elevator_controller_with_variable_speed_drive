**Working Process**

Accurate knowledge of the working process of the elevator system was obtained and represented using a flowchart. The flowchart outlines the automatic and manual operation modes as well as the local and remote control situations.

**Operator Interaction**

The operator's interaction in both automatic-manual and local-remote work situations was explained in detail. This includes the steps required for the operator to switch between different modes and control the elevator's movements.

**Safety Points**
The required safety points in the elevator control system were identified and emphasized. These safety points include emergency stop procedures, door sensors, and overload protection.

**Inputs and Outputs**
All inputs and outputs of the elevator control system were described. This includes raw materials (e.g., user commands), products from another unit (e.g., floor sensors), and inputs/outputs received from other departments, specifying their names.

**Additional Items for Failure**
Additional components and systems required to handle failures in the elevator control system were identified. These include backup power supplies, emergency braking systems, and communication redundancy.

**Disturbances and Prioritization**
Perceived disturbances in the elevator system's performance were listed and prioritized based on their impact on safety and functionality. Mitigation strategies were proposed for each disturbance.

**Modeling and Simulation**
The elevator control system was modeled and simulated to assess its behavior under various conditions and loads. Simulation results were analyzed to optimize the system's performance.

**Sensors and Operators**
Appropriate sensors and operators for the elevator control system were selected to ensure accurate feedback and precise control of elevator movements.

**PID Controller Design**
For continuous process control, a PID controller was designed and implemented to regulate elevator movements and improve ride comfort.

**Advanced Controller Design**
Advanced control strategies, such as fuzzy logic or model predictive control, were considered for more sophisticated and efficient elevator operation.

Dealing with Disorders
Strategies to deal with the effects of disorders, such as power outages or water leaks, were developed to ensure the safety and stability of the elevator system.

**Foreseeable Defects**
Foreseeable defects in the performance of both automatic and manual control cases were investigated, and solutions were provided to address these issues.

**PLC Selection**
A suitable PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) was chosen to control the elevator system based on its specifications and requirements.

**PLC Program Structure**
The structure of the PLC program was explained, and the required modules of the program were defined to achieve the desired control logic.

**PLC Programming**
PLC program modules were coded, either directly or in a generic form using a common PLC programming language, to control the elevator system effectively.
