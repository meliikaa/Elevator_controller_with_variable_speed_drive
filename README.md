# Elevator_controller_with_variable_speed_drive
1-Accurate knowledge of the working process of project items was obtained. 2-Drawing the work process of the project cases in the form of a flowchart and explaining the automatic-manual, local-remote work situations
3-Explaining how the operator interacts in automatic-manual and local-remote work situations in both cases 4- clarification of required safety points 5- Explanation of inputs and outputs (raw materials, products of another unit, etc.). If these inputs and outputs are received from another department, their names should also were mentioned.
6-Explanation of the additional items required for project in case of failure.7-demonstrating of perceived disturbances in system performance and their prioritization.8-Modeling and simulation. 9-Choosing the right sensors and operators 9-PID controller design for the case of continuous process.10-Advanced controller desig.
11-Providing a solution to deal with the effects of disorders
12-Investigating and providing solutions for foreseeable defects in the performance of both cases (power outages, water leaks, etc.).
13-Choosing the right PLC to control the system
14-Definition of control inputs and outputs and its matching with selected PLC inputs and outputs
15-Explaining the structure of the PLC program and defining the required modules of the program
16-Coding of PLC program modules if possible or in a generic form based on one of the common PLC programming languages
